| 🏨 [ Hotel Cancellation Prediction](https://github.com/yc247/data-science-portfolio/blob/main/machine-learning/Hotel_Cancellation_Prediction.ipynb) | EDA, Machine Learning | I conducted a comprehensive analysis of user churn by examining customer behavior, from data preprocessing to model deployment. I engineered features and implemented a model pipeline—including Random Forest, Boosting, and ANN—optimizing each to achieve high accuracy and recall. This project provided actionable insights that supported strategic decisions to reduce churn. |

| 📦 [LiA - LLM Based Interview Prep Tool](https://github.com/jrauvola/LIA) | LLM, GCP | LiA is a LLM-powered interview preparation tool designed to help users hone their skills and build confidence through tailored practice questions and feedback. The LiA project began with my personal journey into the data science field, where I recognized the dual benefits of interview preparation as both a learning tool and  a key to advancing in one’s career. Seeing the challenges that many face while preparing for data science interviews, I formed a team who shared my vision of how LLMs could streamline the process. Together, we developed LiA as our capstone project for our master’s degree.  |

| 📦 [Amazon US Sales Data Analysis]() | Amazon is the largest online retail marketplace in the USA. Amid this dynamic marketplace, sellers continually seek avenues for enhancing their sales performance. To delve into this challenge, I scrutinized a comprehensive dataset of products selling on Amazon US, analyzing the multifaceted factors at play. These factors encompass pricing strategies, customer ratings, promotional discounts, and product titles, all of which collectively shape and influence sales performance | [Dashboard](https://public.tableau.com/shared/BXPGBPB7P?:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link)
