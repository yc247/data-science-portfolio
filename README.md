Seeing the challenges that many face while preparing for data science interviews, I formed a team who shared my vision of how LLMs could streamline the process. Together, we developed LiA as our capstone project for our masterâ€™s degree. LiA is an AI-powered interview preparation tool designed to help users hone their skills and build confidence through tailored practice questions and feedback. By leveraging advanced natural language processing techniques, LiA connects users with relevant resources, making the interview preparation process more efficient and effective. |
